# [C# 2023 FROM ZERO TO PRO](https://youtu.be/w8rRhAup4kg)
The course I'm taking as a starting point in learning C# thoroughly. 
I decided to learn more about C# from the very basics because I was tired of redoing the same mechanics in my games due to a lack of knowledge and experience. 
No, seriously, I only recently learned the difference between lists and arrays, I canâ€™t live like that!
